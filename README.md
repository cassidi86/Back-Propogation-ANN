Back-Propogation-ANN
====================

Neural network in the form of Back Propogation


===================
About:
This Neural network uses back propogation to change the weight matrix. 
The initial values are stored in "inputDataMatrix" and the expected values are stored in "expectedDataMatrix"
After running, a plot will show up with a graph of the root mean square error for each repetitiong. Minimizing this is fundemental the network's success.
